# agent-device

Use agent-device only for app/device automation tasks.
Before planning device work, run `agent-device --version` and read `agent-device help workflow`.
For TV, Fire TV, or Vega OS tasks, read `agent-device help tv`.
For exploratory QA, read `agent-device help dogfood`.
For logs, network, audio, traces, or runtime failures, read `agent-device help debugging`.
For React Native component trees, props/state/hooks, slow renders, or rerenders, read `agent-device help react-devtools`.
For React Native JavaScript heap growth, heap snapshots, or retained-object leaks, read `agent-device help cdp`.
For React Native apps, overlays, Metro/Fast Refresh blockers, and routing to React DevTools or debugging evidence, read `agent-device help react-native`.

Use the CLI in the integrated terminal.
If `agent-device` is not on PATH but the user installed it globally in another shell, resolve the absolute binary path instead of using `npx -y agent-device@latest`.
Prefer `open -> snapshot -i -> act -> re-snapshot -> verify -> close` where supported; otherwise follow target-specific help.
Keep mutating commands against one session serial.
